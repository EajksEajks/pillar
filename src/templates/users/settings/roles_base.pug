p.
	Here is some behind-the-scenes info! In order to define what you can do on this website, we rely
	on a system of #[em roles] and #[em capabilities]. For example, every website user "can-read" a
	post, but only editors "can-write" and "can-edit" it.

p.
	Your roles are determined by multiple factors, such as being part of an organisation, being
	subscribed to a service, etcâ€¦ Your capabilities are determined by the roles you have.

p.
	If the website does not work as expected (for example you received permission-related errors),
	it is often useful to mention what your Roles and Capabilities are when asking for support.
